"""Derive each GA registry's configuration from the Preview registry it will replace.

This tool migrates *records*. The registry itself is not created for you, because its
``discoveryConfiguration`` decides who may read it and its ``approvalConfiguration`` decides what
happens to submitted records -- decisions, not data to be copied. What this module removes is the
guesswork: it reads a source registry (read-only) and returns the equivalent GA ``CreateRegistry``
input with the preview shape already translated:

* top-level ``authorizerType`` / ``authorizerConfiguration`` nested under ``discoveryConfiguration``
* ``approvalConfiguration.autoApproval: true`` becomes ``autoApprovalRules: ["APPROVE_ALL"]``

Nothing here writes to any registry. The migration calls only record-level operations, so creating
the registry is one ``aws agent-registry-control create-registry`` call the operator makes with the
payload below.
